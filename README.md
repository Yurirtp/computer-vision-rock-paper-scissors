# Computer Vision RPS

## Milestone 1

This github repo was created

## Milestone 2

Images were taken of the rock, paper, scissors, and nothing options in teachable machine, and the model was downloaded.

Download the model from the "Tensorflow" tab in Teachable-Machine. The model should be named keras_model.h5 and the text file containing the labels should be named labels.txt.

The files you are downloading contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model. They are not files that can be run, and they do not contain anything readable if you look inside. Later, you will load them into your Python application in the next milestone.

Make sure you push the model and labels to your GitHub repository after committing.
